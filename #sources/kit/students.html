                        <p class="student__text">
                            Rahim was born in the slums of Mumbai, India. His first message was, "Please, can I have one free signal?" to which we naturally declined as we are a commercial organization, not a church. After that, he disappeared for a week. Then, he managed to find the money and bought a discounted subscription for one month. I don't remember how much it cost, but I do remember he had only $50 left for trading. It was a risky decision, wasn't it? After a month, he sent us a screenshot of his balance, which was $5000, and that's what we call a result. Five years later, he is one of our fund's investors and has earned more than $100,000 during that time.

                            Lisa is a prime example of how one should earn. She bought a standard 6-month package, went through the training, and was immediately recognized as an exemplary student by her manager with no objections. She absorbed all the information greedily.

                            This story will tell you about how important discipline is in trading, and once again we remind you that under no circumstances should you deviate from our instructions. Our system has been developed over 10 years and has shown its strength over the long term.
                        </p>
                        <p class="student__text">
                            Aslan was one of our clients with whom we have had problems with in the past, as they were disobedient, acted as they pleased, and then came to us with problems and lost money. In just four days, he lost $5000 on our signals by entering trades not at the specified entry points and sometimes taking positions in the opposite direction, which puzzled us since he had purchased a lifetime subscription. We refunded him the full amount, but on our terms. He then completed a three-month course during which he traded exclusively on paper and was not allowed to deviate from the plan. After three months, we returned his money and allowed him to trade. Can you guess what happened next?
                        </p>
                        <p class="student__text">
                            He made $70,000 in just two months. You don't need to come up with your own strategies, as we provide training before trading begins. However, if you deviate from this plan, we will be forced to restrict your actions and will not allow you to trade until we are confident in your knowledge.
