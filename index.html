                    <p class="advantage__text">
                        Thanks to our software, you can fully automate your trading and not spend a single minute on it. How does it work? Using Binance API keys, we connect you to our trading bot, which enters all signals. You will be assigned an individual manager who will take financial responsibility for your trades and maximize your profit. This is completely safe as we do not have access to your Binance account and cannot withdraw your funds, only open trades on futures.

                                Rahim was born in the slums of Mumbai, India. His first message was, "Please, can I have one free signal?" to which we naturally declined as we are a commercial organization, not a church. After that, he disappeared for a week. Then, he managed to find the money and bought a discounted subscription for one month. I don't remember how much it cost, but I do remember he had only $50 left for trading. It was a risky decision, wasn't it? After a month, he sent us a screenshot of his balance, which was $5000, and that's what we call a result. Five years later, he is one of our fund's investors and has earned more than $100,000 during that time.

                            Aslan was one of our clients with whom we have had problems with in the past, as they were disobedient, acted as they pleased, and then came to us with problems and lost money. In just four days, he lost $5000 on our signals by entering trades not at the specified entry points and sometimes taking positions in the opposite direction, which puzzled us since he had purchased a lifetime subscription. We refunded him the full amount, but on our terms. He then completed a three-month course during which he traded exclusively on paper and was not allowed to deviate from the plan. After three months, we returned his money and allowed him to trade. Can you guess what happened next?

                            He made $70,000 in just two months. You don't need to come up with your own strategies, as we provide training before trading begins. However, if you deviate from this plan, we will be forced to restrict your actions and will not allow you to trade until we are confident in your knowledge.
